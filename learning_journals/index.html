            <h2> 🕹 Game On! Studio Project Pre-Work </h2>
            <h5> ⌚ May 17, 2021 @ 5:00 PM </h5>
            <p>
                Upon reading the article, <strong><a href = "https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">"Game Design UX Best Practices" by Amir Dori</a></strong> I was once again amazed at the <strong>detail-oriented and psychologically-adept thinking</strong> that goes into the art of game design. Positioning and the content of key elements play a pivotal role in the final user experience of the game. <br/><br/>
                
                <strong>UI Positioning,</strong> particularly the ease and accessibility of game and monetization buttons plays a key role in determining the game's eventual success. If 'start' or 'pause' buttons are out of the user's reach, for instance, this may cause frustration and force a user to quit out of the game. Moreover, the poor positioning of <strong>monetization</strong> buttons may prevent the game from not only scaling, but also satisfying advertisers who count on the game's popularity to sell their advertisements.
                <br/><br/>

                What was most interesting to me, though, was the <strong>small details!</strong> For instance, when a user is given a pop-up, instead of using a conventional 'X' button that we see on websites, Dori suggests we use title the 'X' button using different <strong>labeling strategies</strong> as well as move it out of the top-right corner of the pop-up screen. This is done to remove the typical frustration that users have with conventional pop-ups that remove/distract them from their flow of action while using the game.
                <br/><br/>

                Game Design is most certainly a <strong>science and an art,</strong> as it takes incredible knowledge of human psychology, UI theory, and a love for crafting the perfect game experience for the end user.

            <h2> 🌌 Every Picture, Studio Project Pre-Work </h2>
            <h5> ⌚ May 5, 2021 @ 10:00 PM </h5>

            <h4>Part 1</h4>
            <p>
                As I start my second studio project, <strong>"Every Picture,"</strong> I wanted to practice my visual analysis skills. Thus, I will be analyzing two pictures, one from my collection and one from my peer's collection.<br/> <br/>
                
                The first image is interesting to me as it is of someone who I met last year through an Indian Classical Dance team I joined, someone who I now call an honorary 'sister'! Here, Krithi stands in front of the gardens surrounding the <strong>Manetti Shrem Museum in UC Davis</strong> early in the morning. Due to the quiet hour, the light peaking in behind her is golden of color, and I've edited the trees to be a complementary green. Krithi's outfit and accessories are white and gold in color, as this was a club photoshoot and we chose a simple aesthetic to promote unity and cohesion. <br/> <br/>

                This image relates to my topic as it is a photograph I took, and thus will be a part of the <strong>Photography Portfolio</strong> I hope to create for this studio project. Krithi's picture is one of many that I hope to display on my Every Picture project site; as each photoshoot has a distinctive color pallette, the other pictures from this day also have the same colors; thus, I hope to identify a color pallette for each photoshoot to create a more design-related project. <br/> <br/>

                This collection says something about me as my photography is a reflection of how I see my friends, and how I see the world around me. Photoshoots I take are often with friends, and being able to document these happy memories brings me immense joy. I often get told that I have a rosy filter on the world around me, as I choose to, for my own sanity, <strong>look for only the good around me</strong>. My photography captures this very notion, and I wouldn't have it any other way! <br/> <br/>

            <h4>Part 2</h4>
            <p>
                I believe this image is of Alyssa's incredibly cool <strong>camera collection!</strong> I can tell that these cameras mean a lot to Alyssa as she has kept them, along with vintage Kodak memorabilia, incredibly safe in a glass display shelf. I believe Alyssa is a photographer who has an unique love for shooting with film, hence the film cameras!<br/> <br/>

                On the whole seem to be artistically monochromatic, with the splashes of saturated color coming from the Kodak memorabilia, Polaroid card, and blue-ish tint from the lens reflections. The location of these items appears to be in Alyssa's home, further emphasizing her appreciation of photography. The <strong>tone of this image is stoic,</strong> almost as if the cameras themselves understand the significance of the broad history they have documented.<br/> <br/>

                The most interesting or mysterious part of this picture is identifying the history behind all of these incredible film cameras, as well as the history of the Kodak memorabilia! As someone who loves identifying the origin of <strong>vintage artifacts,</strong> I would love to examine the cameras in more detail and figure out their unique, individual stories.<br/> <br/>

            <h2> 📸 Photography & Visual Thinking Skills </h2>
            <h5> ⌚ April 28, 2021 @ 5:00 PM </h5>
            <p>
                Upon reading the article, <strong><a href = "https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" by Michael Gonchar</a></strong>, I was reminded of the unique ability of a photograph to quite instantaneously stop still the moving hands of your internal clock of life. <br/> <br/>
                
                Photographs are static, <strong>momentary snapshots</strong> and yet have the ability to linger on your mind years after you've laid your eyes on them. Why is that? <br/><br/>

                When reading Gonchar's argument for using photographs as a way to teach <strong>close reading & visual analysis skills</strong>, I realized that as humans ourselves, we are naturally curious to know more about other humans, for instance, particularly those 1,000+ miles away in unknown environments, facing unknown internal & external battles. <br/><br/>

                For instance, in the article's fourth section, titled <strong>"Notice Details,"</strong> the author places an image of a juvenile back flipping off of rubbles. Josh W. further analyzes the picture, and states that the juvenile appears to be in pain. <br/><br/>

                While noticing details helps build a narrative around a still frame, I believe <strong>empathy</strong> is the highest-level takeaway from visual analysis. Photographs are shards of reality; they force us to confront present, global challenges, even when half-way across the world from the source. <br/><br/>

                Challenges are one side of the coin--successes are the other! My favorite example of photography display is <strong><a href = "https://images.nasa.gov/">NASA's Images and Video Library</a></strong>. On this site, NASA posts exclusive, close-up shots of the people and places behind their successful space explorations. <br/><br/>

                I admire how personal the images feel, as well as how clicking on an image redirects you to a separate page, complete with a summary of the picture's context & other fine details. The <strong>high-resolution image gallery</strong> is searchable by keyword, file type, and is filterable by popularity and date, making the site incredibly easy to use.

            <h2> 🪟 Modals, Overlays, & Dialog Windows </h2>
            <h5> ⌚ April 21, 2021 @ 10:00 PM </h5>
            <p>
                Upon reading the article, <strong><a href = "https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows" by Naema Baskanderi</a></strong>, I've noticed how hard it is for product & web designers to work around users' default behavior, namely the 'reflex' users have developed over the years of dealing with pesky advertising & merchandise discounts--immediately clicking out of modals, overlays, and dialog windows! <br/> <br/>

                The author maintains that the main<strong> use cases for these web elements</strong> include grabbing the user's attention, obtaining information from the user, showing the user additional information in context, as well as showing additional not-in-context information. <br/> <br/>
                
                While all of these use cases aim to interact with the user, Baskanderi warns us that if modals, overlays, and dialog windows are not properly created, <strong>users may quickly dismiss the window,</strong> missing all information the designer of the page hoped to collect or display to the end user. <br/> <br/>

                In order to combat this response to surprise behavior, the author gives us great insights. Instead of these web elements automatically displaying
                on page load, they are <strong>only displayed following a user's action</strong> such as a button click, link click, or selecting an option on the web page. <br/> <br/>

                Indeed, <strong>a user's default behavior cannot be changed</strong>; it is up to the designer to design around these built-in behaviors to create the most engaging, functional web experience!

            <h2> 🖋️ Form Design </h2>
            <h5> ⌚ April 14, 2021 @ 5:00 PM </h5>
            <p> 
                Upon reading the article, <strong><a href = "https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for form design" by Salim Ansari</a></strong>, I've come to truly appreciate and understand the vision behind the Inclusive Product Design Movement, one that i've been following since the start of my fascination with Product Management. <br/> <br/>
                
                <strong class = important>Inclusive Product Design</strong> focuses on shifting the paradigm of the design process to include diversity & inclusivity from the very beginning of the product design life cycle, and designing for all types of users--not just one.  <br/> <br/>

                Thus, the section of the article titled <strong>"Accessibility"</strong> stood out to me in particular. The section highlights key details regarding improving accessibility for forms, especially in regards to color, text-size, and labels. <br/> <br/> 
                
                For instance, in regards to color, Ansari details how designers should be mindful of ensuring that the <strong>contrast</strong> between the foreground and background meet the minimum contrast ratio as instituted by the WCAG, as well as not using solely color to indicate changes in status to account for the color-blind population of users. <br/> <br/>
                
                The author has insightful perspective in regards to <strong>empathizing</strong> with the accessibility troubles of minority groups, an understanding every designer would hope to develop!
