            <h2> üì∏ Photography & Visual Thinking Skills </h2>
            <h5> ‚åö April 28, 2021 @ 5:00 PM </h5>
            <p>
                Upon reading the article, <strong><a href = "https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" by Michael Gonchar</a></strong>, I was reminded of the unique ability of a photograph to quite instantaneously stop still the moving hands of your internal clock of life. <br/> <br/>
                
                Photographs are static, <strong>momentary snapshots</strong> and yet have the ability to linger on your mind years after you've laid your eyes on them. Why is that? <br/><br/>

                When reading Gonchar's argument for using photographs as a way to teach <strong>close reading & visual analysis skills</strong>, I realized that as humans ourselves, we are naturally curious to know more about other humans, for instance, particularly those 1,000+ miles away in unknown environments, facing unknown internal & external battles. <br/><br/>

                For instance, in the article's fourth section, titled <strong>"Notice Details,"</strong> the author places an image of a juvenile back flipping off of rubbles. Josh W. further analyzes the picture, and states that the juvenile appears to be in pain. <br/><br/>

                While noticing details helps build a narrative around a still frame, I believe <strong>empathy</strong> is the highest-level takeaway from visual analysis. Photographs are shards of reality; they force us to confront present, global challenges, even when half-way across the world from the source. <br/><br/>

                Challenges are one side of the coin--successes are the other! My favorite example of photography display is <strong><a href = "https://images.nasa.gov/">NASA's Images and Video Library</a></strong>. On this site, NASA posts exclusive, close-up shots of the people and places behind their successful space explorations. <br/><br/>

                I admire how personal the images feel, as well as how clicking on an image redirects you to a separate page, complete with a summary of the picture's context & other fine details. The <strong>high-resolution image gallery</strong> is searchable by keyword, file type, and is filterable by popularity and date, making the site incredibly easy to use.

            <h2> ü™ü Modals, Overlays, & Dialog Windows </h2>
            <h5> ‚åö April 21, 2021 @ 10:00 PM </h5>
            <p>
                Upon reading the article, <strong><a href = "https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows" by Naema Baskanderi</a></strong>, I've noticed how hard it is for product & web designers to work around users' default behavior, namely the 'reflex' users have developed over the years of dealing with pesky advertising & merchandise discounts--immediately clicking out of modals, overlays, and dialog windows! <br/> <br/>

                The author maintains that the main<strong> use cases for these web elements</strong> include grabbing the user's attention, obtaining information from the user, showing the user additional information in context, as well as showing additional not-in-context information. <br/> <br/>
                
                While all of these use cases aim to interact with the user, Baskanderi warns us that if modals, overlays, and dialog windows are not properly created, <strong>users may quickly dismiss the window,</strong> missing all information the designer of the page hoped to collect or display to the end user. <br/> <br/>

                In order to combat this response to surprise behavior, the author gives us great insights. Instead of these web elements automatically displaying
                on page load, they are <strong>only displayed following a user's action</strong> such as a button click, link click, or selecting an option on the web page. <br/> <br/>

                Indeed, <strong>a user's default behavior cannot be changed</strong>; it is up to the designer to design around these built-in behaviors to create the most engaging, functional web experience!

            <h2> üñãÔ∏è Form Design </h2>
            <h5> ‚åö April 14, 2021 @ 5:00 PM </h5>
            <p> 
                Upon reading the article, <strong><a href = "https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for form design" by Salim Ansari</a></strong>, I've come to truly appreciate and understand the vision behind the Inclusive Product Design Movement, one that i've been following since the start of my fascination with Product Management. <br/> <br/>
                
                <strong class = important>Inclusive Product Design</strong> focuses on shifting the paradigm of the design process to include diversity & inclusivity from the very beginning of the product design life cycle, and designing for all types of users--not just one.  <br/> <br/>

                Thus, the section of the article titled <strong>"Accessibility"</strong> stood out to me in particular. The section highlights key details regarding improving accessibility for forms, especially in regards to color, text-size, and labels. <br/> <br/> 
                
                For instance, in regards to color, Ansari details how designers should be mindful of ensuring that the <strong>contrast</strong> between the foreground and background meet the minimum contrast ratio as instituted by the WCAG, as well as not using solely color to indicate changes in status to account for the color-blind population of users. <br/> <br/>
                
                The author has insightful perspective in regards to <strong>empathizing</strong> with the accessibility troubles of minority groups, an understanding every designer would hope to develop!
