                <h2>user I - tim</h2>
                <p>With this current iteration, when the user hovers over the color in the palette, the background color of the section temporarily changes using the 'mouseover' event listener, and changes back to the default setting after the the mouse leaves the color. <br/> <br/>

                However, Tim suggested that when the user clicks on the color in the palettes, the background color of the section changes permanently. This is to offer a more fixed view of the portfolio images against the palette color, as well as maximize the interaction on the webpage. I will certainly be making this change in my final iteration!</p>

            </section>
            <section id = "user-2">
                <h2>user II - peter</h2>
                <p>With this current iteration, the portfolio images displayed cannot be interacted with by the user. Personally, I had a couple ideas on user interaction with the images, but did not have any I was confident in being able to do with the limited time I have during Week 10! Currently, the images have a dark-gray drop-shadow. <br/> <br/>
                
                However, Peter suggested that when the user clicks on the image, the drop-shadow color of the image changes to one that will offer maximum contrast to create a 'glow.' I will certainly be making this change as it plays well with my theme of bold colors and contrast!</p>
                <img src = "images/user-2.png" alt = "user2-image" width = 300 height = 188>
            </section>
            <section id = "user-3">
                <h2>user III - annette</h2>
                <p>With this current iteration, there are no 'close' buttons for pop-ups & overlays, which Annette noticed and immediately notified me about. Moreover, currently, the images have no user-based behavior. <br/> <br/>

                Annette suggested that when the user hovers over the image, another image will pop-up related to the person the image features. For instance, for the first section on the Indian Classical Dance Team at UC Davis, when the user hovers over an image, another image from a stage performance will replace the original image. This would add a warm narrative, which I love and will certainly implement!</p>
