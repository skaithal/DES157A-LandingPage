            <h2> 👩🏽‍💼 project summary</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to reinvent the "Every Picture" studio project, my Photography Portfolio, to include more user interaction, scroll techniques, as well as photo narrative techniques.</p>

            <p>The first example is <strong><a href = "https://www.lnaylor.com/">Lauren Naylor's Photography Portfolio.</a></strong> I admire the minimal black/white color scheme, which allows Lauren's photos' sophisticated color scheme to shine through. She uses overlays coupled with precise padding to not only give an 'editorial' look to her pictures, but to also highlight key details such as where her photos were used, and by what publication company. The use of a sticky navbar creates a user-friendly layout, as key contact details are static while potential customers scroll through the virtual gallery.

            <h2>👩🏽‍💻 project & ux goals</h2>
            <p>The comparison examples used minimalistic, clean themes for their site elements and placed large, cohesive pictures in a structured layout for maximum visual effect. I plan on using a simmilar philosophy with the added touch of color to complement the colors in the pictures (background & scroll).</p>

        <section id = "red">
            <h2>🎨 design strategies</h2>
            <p>Each photoshoot is its own metaphorical world in terms of design! While each section of the page has a light, pastel background, the colors that stem from the photos' color palletes that will be used for user interactions immensely vary. Overall, the site will be minimal and simple.</p>
        </section>

        <section id = "blue">
            <h2>📱 interaction strategies</h2>
            <p>I plan on using hover & click interactions on my photos to engage users towards the narrative behind my images as well as the color principles that make up a singular photshoot. I additionally want to create automatic changes in background color to reinforce the uniqueness of each photoshoot.</p>
